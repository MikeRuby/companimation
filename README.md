# Companimation

CSS animations. In Compass. Real easy-like. Sodding brilliant.

## Overview

_Another animation extension for Compass? Seriously? But Mike, Why?_

The truth is, I use Compass a lot. Recently I've started using animations a lot more on side projects, so naturally I started looking for a better way to handle them, since currently Compass does not provide any mixins for animations. So... I look around at the extensions already available and decided I'd rather do it my way. So I did. HUZZAH!

Companimation provides two unique things: a basic set of mixins to help you create your own animations, and a collection of presets (both original and sourced from Dan Eden's Animate.css) to get you up and running fast.

## Installation and Usage

Companimation is available as a RubyGem. To install it, open up a terminal and type:

``` bash
gem install companimation
```

After you've installed the gem, getting Companimation into your project is as easy as importing it into your file:

``` scss
@import 'companimation';
```
