# Companimation

## CSS animations. In Compass. Real easy-like. Sodding brilliant.

### Overview

_ Another animation extension for Compass? Seriously? But Mike, Why? _

The truth is, I use Compass a lot. Recently I've started using animations a lot more on certain projects, so naturally I started looking for a better way to handle them since currently Compass does not provide any mixins for animations. So... I looked around at the extensions already available and decided I'd rather do it my way. So I did. HUZZAH!

Companimation provides two unique things: a basic set of mixins to help you create your own animations, and a collection of presets (both original and sourced from [Dan Eden's Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) to get you up and running fast.

### Installation and Usage

Companimation is available as a RubyGem. To install it, open up a terminal and type:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install companimation
{% endhighlight %}
