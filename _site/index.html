<h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>

<p>_ Another animation extension for Compass? Seriously? But Mike, Why? _</p>

<p>The truth is, I use Compass a lot. Recently I&#8217;ve started using animations a lot more on certain projects, so naturally I started looking for a better way to handle them since currently Compass does not provide any mixins for animations. So&#8230; I looked around at the extensions already available and decided I&#8217;d rather do it my way. So I did. HUZZAH!</p>

<p>Companimation provides two unique things: a basic set of mixins to help you create your own animations, and a collection of presets (both original and sourced from <a href='http://daneden.me/animate/'>Dan Eden&#8217;s Animate.css</a> to get you up and running fast.</p>

<h3 id='installation_and_usage'>Installation and Usage</h3>

<p>Companimation is available as a RubyGem. To install it, open up a terminal and type:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>gem install companimation
</code></pre>
